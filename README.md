## 📊 Student Score Analysis  

### 📖 Project Overview  
This project focuses on exploring the relationship between various factors (like parental education, weekly study hours, and ethnic groups) and students' performance in subjects like Math, Reading, and Writing. The analysis is conducted using Python and Jupyter Notebook, leveraging visualizations to derive insights.  

### 🎯 Objective  
The primary objectives are:  
- To understand the factors influencing student scores.  
- To identify patterns and trends among different demographic groups.  
- To explore the impact of study habits on academic performance.  

### 🔍 Key Insights and Features  
- **Gender Distribution**: The number of female students is higher than male students.  
- **Parental Education**: Higher parental education levels positively impact students' scores.  
- **Ethnic Group Analysis**: Students from different ethnic groups show varying score distributions.  
- **Weekly Study Hours**: Surprisingly, some students studying more than 10 hours a week scored zero in Math.  
- **Marital Status**: Parental marital status has no significant impact on student performance.  
### 🛠 Tools and Technologies Used  
- **Programming Languages**: Python 🐍  
- **Libraries**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn  

### 📚 Project Learning  
- Gained hands-on experience with data cleaning and preprocessing.  
- Improved EDA and visualization skills using Python libraries.  
- Learned how to identify and interpret patterns and trends in education-related data.  

### 🚀 How to Use  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Install the required libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).  
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the analysis step by step.
